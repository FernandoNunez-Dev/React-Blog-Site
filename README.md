<h3>With This React Application<h3>
    I utilized React Hooks like useState, useEffect  to put together a small React Blog Single Page Application. I find it very interesting that quite often when scouring the Internet for web development tutorials, and more specifically, React tutorials, it's very easy to find samples with pre-built applications. Then on the other hand, we have such a wonderful amount of resources out on the Internet that contain great pre-built websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But very rarely do these two worlds actually meet. Well, with this project I aimed at showing how to take one of those readily available templates and converting into a fully functional single page application with React.

<h3>I Incorporated Bootstrap</h3>
    So in this case for this React Application, I basically just went onto Google and I searched for a simple Bootstrap blog template. I came across the startbootstrap.com site. And here we have a number of bootstrap blog themes. I went for a blog site template. But ultimately you could go and find any sort of web template from any site.
    I thought this was gonna be a cool way to convert and kind of show the process of going 
    from a Bootstrap template and actually converting it over into a React Single Page Application that anyone can utilize as a website.

<h2 align="center">Recommended Tools</h2>



The following tools are recommended for a React project. Also you will find included below some links for building some complex UI animations and conversion of SVG image into Data URL with the help of Webpack loader.
   
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) UI and components library.
- [ESLint-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/eslint-loader), When using with transpiling loaders(like babel-loader),make sure they are in correct order(bottom to top). Otherwise files will be checked after being processed by babel-loader.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-complex-ui-animation-in-react-simply), For building complex UI animations in React.
- [Webpack CSS-loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) interprets @import and url() like import/require() and will resolve them.
- [SVG-React-Webpack](https://www.pluralsightcomguides-how-to-load-svg-with-react-and-webpack) To utilize  an SVG image in your React project, it will have to be transformed into a Data URL. We will need an  appropriate webpack loader in our bundler.
